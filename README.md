# webhook-utility
Simple golang package to send discord webhook messages. It's just meant for me and my uses so it doesn't really have too much in it.

# Functions

Send, takes a webhook url and a "WebhookPayload" which has content, username, and avatarurl options. Returns an error (hopefully nil xd)
